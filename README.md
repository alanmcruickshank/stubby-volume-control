## TODO

- Add all the scad files and some explanation of what they do (a branch for the original version first and then a dev branch for the new version)
- Add a full set of stl files and the tag that as a *release* before changing them all.
- Add some docs around print settings for best results, especially for the geared components. i.e. RAFTS!
